# Palindrome
Takes in an input and determines if it is a palindrome or not.
Utilises Jest for Unit and Mock testing.

# My approach
I utilised JavaScript's built in functions to:
1. Split the input into an array of characters
2. Reversed the array
3. Turned it back into a string that is a reversed version of the input
4. If reversed string == input, it is a palindrome

# Regex
Used regex to remove non-alphanumeric characters and underscores the moment the input is received

# Other
Uses TailWind for nice CSS
